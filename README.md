Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning and computer vision.

Further, it can be improved by using an attention mechanism
I ran this model for quite a little time so there is some difference between the actual and predicted output 
Here is the prediction of the image which is not used to train the model, you can see the pictures in the "test_images" folder.
